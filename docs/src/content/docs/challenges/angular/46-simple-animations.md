## Information

This is the first of two animation challenges, the goal of this series is to master animations in Angular.

Well-designed animations can make your application more fun and straightforward to use, but they aren't just cosmetic. Animations can improve your application and user experience in a number of ways:

- Without animations, web page transitions can seem abrupt and jarring.
- Motion greatly enhances the user experience, so animations give users a chance to detect the application's response to their actions.
- Good animations intuitively call the user's attention to where it is needed.

I would recommend you to read the [official documentation](https://angular.io/guide/animations). You will learn everything that is necessary to successfully complete the challenge.

Otherwise look at this [working example](https://svenson95.github.io/ng-xmp-animations/) and [git repo](https://github.com/svenson95/ng-xmp-animations) to get inspired.
