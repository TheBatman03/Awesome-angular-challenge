## Information

In this basic exercise, we aim to display an alert whenever at least one checkbox is checked.

## Statement

The alert correctly triggers when clicking on each checkbox separately. However, if you first click on one checkbox and then click on a second one, the alert fails to appear. Why does this happen?

The objective of this challenge is to understand and correct the issue preventing the alert from appearing when the second checkbox is clicked.
