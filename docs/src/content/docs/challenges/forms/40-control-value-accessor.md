## Information

In this exercise, you have to rewrite FeedbackControlComponent. It should implement Control Value Accessor interface.
This interface is crucial for creating custom form controls that can interact seamlessly with Angular's forms API.
The primary goal is to use control in the feedbackForm to eliminate the need for using @Output to retrieve the value and check it.
