## Context

As a member of the development team, you need to address a specific request from the product owner, üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bob. He wants to develop a new feature in response to customer complaints about losing form input information.

## User Story

Here's the feature expressed as a user story (functional expectation) :

"As a user, I would like to have an alert dialog box that appears when I attempt to navigate away from the /form page after I have started entering information into the form."

## Acceptance Criteria

1. On the /form page:

- If the input text has been pre-filled, then an alert dialog box opens.
- Otherwise, the user navigates normally.

2. The content of `dialog.component.ts` must be use for your dialog box content.
3. The appearance and behavior of the alert dialog box must comply with W3C conventions, see [alert dialog pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alertdialog/).
4. Maximize the use of the new concepts and syntax in the latest version of Angular.
